# Silk Dialysis GUI

## Overview
This software is developed as a graphical user interface for a custom
automatic silk dialysis system. Typically, silk needs to be manually
processed for research use. A crucial step is the dialysis of silk solution
after it has been dissolved in LiBr, which occurs over a 48 hour period.
The dialysis solution (DI water) need to be changed for a total of 6 times,
making the process labor-intensive and time-consuming. This software,
combined with custom hardware, constructs a managed system that performs
water changes automatically and allow researchers to simply place silk
solutions into the system and return when dialysis is completed. 

## How to Use
The GUI is using DruidBuilder from DeviceDruid. To control the system using
the GUI, first [install DeviceDruid](https://devicedruid.com/downloads/) on
a compatible platform. Then, connect the Arduino to your device, launch
the DeviceDruid app, and select the Arduino connected.
